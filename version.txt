        Followed the changes to in Standard Version 2.0.4, which fixed
        2 outstanding bugs that were common to both versions of the 
        framework for AS3: Dissallowed re-registration of Mediators in 
        View.registerMediator. For more on this bug, see:
        http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=372
        Modified View.notifyObservers to notify from a copy of the 
        observer list rather than the actual observer list, which may
        change during the notification loop. For more on this bug, see:
        http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=490

1.0.4 - Added notifyObservers back to the IFacade interface. This was the 
        same change made in the Standard Version 2.0.2

1.0.3 - Refactored View.removeMediator method, moving the logic for removing 
        an observer into a removeObserver method (also on IView), which is 
        now called by the Controller.removeCommand method as well as the 
        View.removeMediator method. This fixes the issue described here:
        http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=308.0
        Also, the Proxy.removeProxy method only attempts to remove the Proxy 
        if it is registered. This was the same change made in the Standard 
        Version 2.0.2

1.0.2 - Facade and IFacade get removeCore method. Model and IModel get 
        removeModel method View and IView get removeView method.
        Controller and IController get removeController method. Corrected
        documentation references to core actors, which were moved together
        into the core package. 

1.0.1 - Corrected issue with SimpleCommands not getting their initializeNotifier
        method called. 

1.0   - Initial AS3 MultiCore Port. Based on PureMVC 2.0.1 feature set.
